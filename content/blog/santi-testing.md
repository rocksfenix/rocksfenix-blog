## **Santiago Testing**

When I first learned about Cloudinary back in 2013, it literally seemed like web-development magic. You upload your images and videos to it and, in short order, Cloudinary has served them in the most optimal formats and quality for all browsers and devices. It blew me away. No doubt some of you have felt the same way.
